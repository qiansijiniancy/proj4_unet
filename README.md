# Project 4 Reproduction
**Packages used**
- numpy (http://www.numpy.org)
- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org)
- keras (https://keras.io)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org)
- tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org)
- opencv (https://opencv.org)
- scikit image (https://scikit-image.org/)

**Implementation**
- Our reproduction work is based on the paper **U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
- The original codes are from https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet. 
- Please run Proj4_Unet_Group6_original_codes.ipynb
- The data is orginally from The original dataset is from 2012 isbi challenge (http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/).It has been processed and can find it in folder data.
- We also applied U-Net on other dataset. The preprocess_retinal_dataset.py is used to preprocess data of DRIVE data (https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)
- Please run Proj4_Group6_Add_layers.ipynb for testing our modified model
- Our original codes can also be implemented from Google Colab book at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F1dQjTYLFWzmfQUtKl-l2rpfMb5eAE74
- Our codes of adding one layer in the U-Net model can also be implemented from Google Colab book at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SySDfBMuccRh7sE_ezMpIqv3jW2FDzuZ
- Our data and results can also be found https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-0MteIXxXnF7JJTC9cw3Y9i4CkA29-UC?usp=sharing
